Spring Cloud Config - It is a tool in Spring Ecosystem used for managing configurations across services in a distributed system.

Features:
1. We have different configurations for differet=nt environments ( dev, testing, production), Spring cloud automatically picks the correct one  based on where service is running.
2. If you change in any configuration in central repo, the spring cloud automatically pulls the updates settings, without even restarting. 
3. As it is  stored in version control system (like git), we can track changes over time, and roll back if any changes has to be done.

MS1, MS2, MS3  - fetch prop from Spring Cloud Config Server - this server serves configuration from git

Ex:  We have Config Server MS, and one Microservice which is client.

In Config Server, - add spring-cloud-config-server dependenccy in pom.xml
                  - add @EnableConfigserver annoation to indicate it is a config server.
                  - in application.prop , add git hub url which tells config server where configurtions are stored.

In MS - add spring-cloud-starter-config in pom.xml
      - in application.properties, add config server url : http://localhost:8888 - which points to the address of config server.
       *** In github - give  file name as applicationname.properties.
